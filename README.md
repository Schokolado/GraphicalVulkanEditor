# Graphical Vulkan Editor

This project showcases an implementation of a graphical user interface named `Graphical Vulkan Editor` short `GVE`.
The general purpose is to facilitate configuration management and parameter adjustments for Vulkan-based applications. The GUI provides a user-friendly interface for modifying Vulkan configurations and exporting the settings to be used by the included VulkanProject application.
The included ``Vulkan Project`` application incorporates code and concepts from the Vulkan tutorial by Alexander Overvoorde.

## Vulkan Tutorial Acknowledgment

This project utilizes code and concepts from the Vulkan tutorial by Alexander Overvoorde available at [vulkan-tutorial.com](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/).

I would like to express my gratitude to Alexander Overvoorde for providing such a comprehensive and well-explained Vulkan tutorial. The tutorial greatly contributed to my understanding and implementation of Vulkan in this VulkanProject.

Please note that the code and concepts used from the Vulkan tutorial are appropriately attributed throughout the VulkanProject codebase.

## Graphical Vulkan Editor


### Usage

1. Start the Graphical Vulkan Editor GUI by navigating to the `GraphicalVulkanEditor` folder and running the corresponding executable or script.

2. Within the GUI, you can load existing configurations, check and modify parameters, and save the configurations for future use.

3. To export the configurations, click the "Generate/Export" button. This action generates a `GraphicalVulkanEditorProjectVariables.h` file in the parent directory (`../GraphicalVulkanEditorProjectVariables.h`).

4. Build and run the `VulkanProject` C++ application using your preferred Vulkan development environment.

5. The `VulkanProject` application will now utilize the configurations from the exported `GraphicalVulkanEditorProjectVariables.h` file, allowing for immediate usage of the modified parameters.

### Folder Structure

- `GraphicalVulkanEditor/`: Contains the Graphical Vulkan Editor files and executable/script.
- `resources/`: Includes essential resource files, including assets, for both the GVE and the accompanying Vulkan application.
- `GraphicalVulkanEditorProjectVariables.h`: The exported configuration file generated by the Graphical Vulkan Editor.
- `VulkanProject.sln/`: Contains the VulkanProject source code.
- `GraphicalVulkanEditor/`: Contains the Graphical Vulkan Editor files and executable/script.

## Usage of the VulkanProject.h C++ project

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Schokolado/GraphicalVulkanEditor.git`
2. Modify the .vcxproj file to include the appropriate directories for libraries. Update the paths in to match your own directories in the following sections at `Project` -> `Properties`:
   * `C++` -> `General` -> `Additional Include Directories`
   * `Linker` -> `General` -> `Additional Library Directories`
3. For the Release configuration, add `shaderc_combined.lib` to `Linker` -> `Input` -> `Additional Dependencies`.
4. For the Debug configuration, add `shaderc_combinedd.lib` to `Linker` -> `Input` -> `Additional Dependencies` (note the additional `d` for debug on the `shaderc` library). 
5. Run the GVE-GUI and export the configuration
6. Build and run the project using your preferred Vulkan development environment.
7. To quickly modify configuration parameters and instantly observe the updated outcome, repeat steps 5 and 6.
