# VulkanProject

This project showcases my implementation of a Vulkan-based application named VulkanProject. It incorporates code and concepts from the Vulkan tutorial by Alexander Overvoorde.

## Vulkan Tutorial Acknowledgment

This project utilizes code and concepts from the Vulkan tutorial by Alexander Overvoorde available at [vulkan-tutorial.com](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/).

I would like to express my gratitude to Alexander Overvoorde for providing such a comprehensive and well-explained Vulkan tutorial. The tutorial greatly contributed to my understanding and implementation of Vulkan in this VulkanProject.

Please note that the code and concepts used from the Vulkan tutorial are appropriately attributed throughout the VulkanProject codebase.

## Vulkan Setup GUI

To facilitate configuration management and parameter adjustments, this project includes a Vulkan Setup GUI. The GUI provides a user-friendly interface for modifying Vulkan configurations and exporting the settings to be used by the VulkanProject application.

### Usage

1. Start the Vulkan Setup GUI by navigating to the `VulkanSetupGUI` folder and running the corresponding executable or script.

2. Within the GUI, you can load existing configurations, check and modify parameters, and save the configurations for future use.

3. To export the configurations, click the "Export" button. This action generates a `VulkanProjectVariables.h` file in the parent directory (`../VulkanProjectVariables.h`).

4. Build and run the `VulkanProject` application using your preferred Vulkan development environment.

5. The `VulkanProject` application will now utilize the configurations from the exported `VulkanProjectVariables.h` file, allowing for immediate usage of the modified parameters.

### Folder Structure

- `VulkanSetupGUI/`: Contains the Vulkan Setup GUI files and executable/script.
- `VulkanProject/`: Contains the VulkanProject source code.
- `VulkanProjectVariables.h`: The exported configuration file generated by the Vulkan Setup GUI.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/VulkanProject.git`
2. Modify the .vcxproj file to include the appropriate directories for libraries. Update the paths to match your own directories.
4. Build and run the project using your preferred Vulkan development environment.
5. For the Release configuration, add `shaderc_combined.lib` to Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies.
6. For the Debug configuration, add `shaderc_combinedd.lib` to Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies (note the additional `d` for debug on the `shaderc` library).
